        <h2 id="whatMOAA">What is the MOAA?
            
        </h2>
        <p id="andy1"> The Math Open At Andover is an annual mathematics competition for middle schoolers, hosted by Phillips Academy
            Andover in Andover, Massachusetts. Although MOAA is traditionally held on campus, MOAA 2021 will be held virtually
            due to COVID-19 concerns. The competition will be held on October 10th, 2021. Through MOAA, middle school students
            can experience mathematical exploration, collaboration, and competition. We hope to promote the involvement of
            middle school students in the mathematical community with a fulfilling, intellectually stimulating, and fun experience
            for everybody.</p>
        <br><br>

        <p>The problems and formatting of MOAA are inspired by the most memorable competition
            questions that we have encountered in our own competition mathematics journeys. Attending the MOAA
            competition is more than a standalone event - it is also designed to prepare students for other high school
            contests and give them a valuable taste of the mathematics that may await them in the future. As the
            organizers of the MOAA, we are passionate mathematicians and we would love to show you a good time at
            Phillips Academy Andover (virtually this year)!</p>

            <br><br><br>
        
        <h2 id="whoAttend">Who Can Attend?</h2>

        <p>Students can attend if they are in 8th grade or below. Teams consist of 1 to 4 students with no
            restrictions (as everything will be virtual, team members can be from different schools, different states,
            or even different countries). Because MOAA 2020 will entirely consist of team competitions, we recommend
            that you pick team members that you know well and can work with.</p>
